# Machine-Vision
* Fit one Gaussian model to the data for skin and another Gaussian to non-skin pixels, and use this to find the posterior probability that each pixel in an image is skin.
* Fit a mixture of Gaussians model to one dimensional data.
* Fit a mixture of Gaussians model to RGB (multi-dimensional) data.
* Use mixtures of Gaussians to distinguish apple vs. non-apple pixels in real photos.
* Quantify and report your results applying a range of thresholds to the posterior to produce sets of True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN), and using a ROC curve.
